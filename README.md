# Minimal posets

Minimal posets that have a given number of antichains. This is also the poset structure of minimal conjunctive networks with a given number of stable steady states. Page s corresponds to s antichains. The first page contains the empty set.

File minimal_posets_drawn_all_noniso.pdf contains the posets for s from 1 to 100. All posets shown are nonisomorphic with respect to permutation and reflection (top-bottom). For example, Page 7 shows that at least 4 elements are needed.

File minimal_posets_drawn_min_edges.pdf contains the posets in minimal_posets_drawn_all_noniso.pdf that also have the minimal number of edges.
